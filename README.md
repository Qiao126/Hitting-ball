# Hitting-ball
This is a simple hitting task in Unity3D with Oculus Rift and Leap Motion

There are two different experiments. The first one is a blinking task (Blinking.cs). The ball is blinking with given blinking and rest
duration. The second task is to hit the ball to the target wall in the back (boxer.cs). The closer it hits the center, the higher score 
will be. 

In both experiments, the detection mode for colision can be changed. You can either choose the three modes in Unity3D or our 
detection mode by changing the parameter in the inspector window.
